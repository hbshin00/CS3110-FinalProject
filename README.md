# CS3110_FinalProject

Final project for CS 3110: Functional Programming and Data Structures, authored by Hali Shin, Abhyuday Atal, Dhruv Girgenti

Implementation from scratch of Texas Hold'em Poker (for one player, with CPU's) in OCaml

(Note: The implementation is fully functioning but by no means optimized/final; in particular, the betting logic for the CPU's needs refinement.)
